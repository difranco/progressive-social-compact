# Progressive Social Compact

This is a draft of rules and behaviors that can help make shared spaces accessible to as many people with as many backgrounds as possible. Here are some things that people should agree to:

* Don't use slurs! Some small exceptions for reclamatory speech, but for the most part no.

* Use peoples' preferred names and pronouns.

* Maintain physical and sexual boundaries. Assume people are uninterested in intimate contact or discussion until proven otherwise.
